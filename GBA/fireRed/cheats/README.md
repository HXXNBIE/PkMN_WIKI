## Hi! Before any download, it's important that you keep the following in mind:
For the **fireRedCodes.cht** file to be recognized by your emulator, once you've downloaded the file, you must rename it to match your ROM's name.

*Example: If your ROM is named "Pokemon_Fire_Red.zip", the cheat file must be named **"Pokemon_Fire_Red.cht"**.*

In short, you should end up with two file sharing the same name, *with the only difference being their file extensions (**Name.zip = Name.cht**).*
