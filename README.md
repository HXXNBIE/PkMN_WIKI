# 🌐 *PkMN_WIKI*
  *Repository created to learn and practice different programming languages. The main goal of this repository is to document and organize all available information about the core Pokémon games for the Game Boy Advance.*  

## 🔍 *Purpose*
  *This idea stems from how convenient it is for me to have a more accessible and user-friendly wiki (hehe). It’s not meant to be useful to others—just a personal project aimed at practicing programming, as I mentioned earlier.*  

## ⚙️ *Languages (Standard/Programming)*
- Standard: XML, JSON
- Programming: SQL
- Tools: Git, DB Browser, MySql
